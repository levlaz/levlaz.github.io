          <td>Pete Buttigieg</td>
          <td>I don&rsquo;t normally do political memoirs but this one stood out to me. I love his story of a day in the life of a Mayor, it reminds me of Anthony Bourdain&rsquo;s version of him in his kitchen. I wonder who the first person to do this style was? The chapter with the proposal was special, made me cry during a long walk. Pete inspires me.</td>

          <td>Cory Doctorow</td>
          <td>&ldquo;Little Brother for Adults&rdquo;, I love the universe that Cory Doctorow creates for Marty Hench. I was immediately sucked in. He sniped me with all of the San Francisco references which was one of the reasons I loved Little Brother so much. This book was captivating, a page turner, I finished it in two days. A couple of cliches sprinkled throughout but I think Docotorow has earned it it at this point.</td>

          <td>The Bezzle</td>
          <td>Cory Doctorow</td>
